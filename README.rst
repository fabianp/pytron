Python bindings for TRON minimization software
==============================================

The main function is pytron.minimize::

    def minimize(func, grad_hess, x0, args=(), max_iter=1000, tol=1e-6):

        Parameters
        ----------
        func : callable
            func(w, *args) is the evaluation of the function at w, It
            should return a float.
        grad: callable
            grad(w, *args) is the gradient of func at w, it
            should return a numpy array of size x0.size
        hess: callable
            hess(w, s, *args) returns the dot product H.dot(s), where
            H is the Hessian matrix at w. It must return a numpy array
            of size x0.size
        tol: float
            stopping criterion. XXX TODO. what is the stopping criterion ?

        Returns
        -------
        w : array



Stopping criterion
------------------

It stops whenever ||grad(x)|| < eps

Examples
--------

Code
----
This software uses the `TRON optimization software
<http://www.mcs.anl.gov/~more/tron/>`_  (files src/tron.{h,cpp}) that was
taken from LIBLINEAR 1.93 (BSD licensed).

The modifications with respect to the orginal code are:

    * Do not initialize values to zero, allow arbitrary initializations

    * Modify stopping criterion to comply with scipy.optimize API. Stop
      whenever gradient is smaller than a given quantity, specified in the
      gtol argument
